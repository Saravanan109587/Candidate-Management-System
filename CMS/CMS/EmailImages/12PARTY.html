        <p class="container" style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:21px">
            Thank you for scheduling a birthday party at the Peabody Museum. Please print this confirmation and bring it on the day of arrival.             
            <table style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:21px">
                <tr>
                    <td>Name: {{OrganizationName}}</td>

                    <td style ="padding-top:20px">Date: {{EventDate}}</td>

                    <td>Confirmation#: {{TransactionId}}</td>

            </table>          
            <span style="color:red">ROOM CAPACITY<br /></span>
            The room capacity of the Party Lab is 25 people. Please let parents know that they are welcome to tour the museum at no cost during the party, but that the Party Lab space is reserved for the invited children to participate in the planned activities.<br />
            <span style="color:red">ROOM SET UP<br /></span>
            The room will be set up with two long tables, covered with tablecloths, on a side wall to hold refreshments and gifts. Four tables in the middle of the room are used for activities, and then are cleaned up for the children to eat. You may bring tablecloths but it is not necessary. Table top decorations are permitted, but no helium ballons please. One wall is decorated with a large Happy Birthday banner.<br />
            <span style="color:red">PARKING<br /></span>
            Free parking is available in the Peabody Museum parking lot across the street on Whitney Avenue, as well as Yale lot number 16 at the corner of Whitney and Humphrey Street. Metered spaces are available on Sachem Street (free on Sunday.)</br>
            <span style="color:red">ARRIVAL<br /></span>
            Our staff will be here to help you set up by 12:30 and will run all party activites, including assistance with refreshments and clean up. Your family and all invited guests are welcome to stay after the party and enjoy the museum!<br />
            <span style="color:red">REFRESHMENTS<br /></span>
            We recomment cupcakes as they are much easier to serve to a large group, saving time on cutting cake means more time for activities! Please remember to bring candles and a lighter, as well as plates, napkins, and serving utensils. If you are having pizza delivered, please ask that it be here by 1:30. Many families order from Abate- 203-776-4334.</br>
            <span style="color:red">BALANCE DUE<br /></span>
            Final balance may be paid at the end of the party via check, cash, or VISA/MASTERCARD/DISCOVER.</br></br>
            Thank you again and we look forward to hosting your child’s celebration!
